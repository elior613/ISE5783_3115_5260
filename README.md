Mini Project in Introduction to Software Engineering 

Authors: Omer Avidar and Elior Tkach

Project Overview
This mini project aimed to introduce and apply key principles in software engineering, including Test-Driven Development, Design Driven Responsibility, and Object-Oriented Programming.
We focused on creating and enhancing a three-dimensional image, employing various techniques to improve image quality and rendering performance.

Part 1: Creating the Image
Following the principles of object-oriented programming, we developed a Squared3D class to construct a room with three-dimensional bodies. 
We applied test-oriented development by creating a Squared3DTest class to validate the functionality of the Squared3D class.
The image was enhanced by implementing lighting sources, shadows, mirrors, and windows.

Part 2: Antialiasing Improvement
In adherence to responsibility-oriented development, we implemented the Antialiasing method to improve image quality.
By shooting multiple rays per pixel, we achieved more accurate colors and smoother curves. We created tests to verify the effectiveness of the Antialiasing enhancement.

Part 3: Image Upgrade
Expanding on object-oriented programming principles, we added a lamp and reflections through a squid3D object.
Two SpotLight sources were utilized to illuminate the scene. We ensured the correctness of these additions through testing.

Part 4: Performance Improvement - Adaptive Supersampling
Following the principles of responsibility-oriented development and object-oriented programming, we implemented the Adaptive supersampling method to optimize rendering time.
By selectively shooting rays based on color differences, we reduced computation while maintaining image quality. We designed tests to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Adaptive supersampling technique.

Part 5: Multithreading Optimization
In line with responsibility-oriented development, we employed multithreading to further optimize rendering performance. By leveraging the principles of object-oriented programming, we divided the rendering process into pixel boundaries and utilized multithreading to speed up the computation. We conducted tests to measure the impact of multithreading on rendering time.

Conclusion
Through the application of Test-Driven Development, Design Driven Responsibility, and Object-Oriented Programming principles, we successfully created and enhanced a three-dimensional image.
We employed techniques such as antialiasing, adaptive supersampling, and multithreading to improve image quality and rendering performance.
This mini project provided valuable hands-on experience in software engineering principles, contributing to our understanding of developing high-quality software solutions.
